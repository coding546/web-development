        // event handler means when we do something from our side like preform any kind of action like pressing down on your keypad or mouse or pressing a key on your keyboard
        // diffferent types of events are  
        // 1. onclick  onclick means when you click on something then something happens 
        // 2. onkeydown this means when we press down in a key board key somethng happens
        // 3. on mouse over on mouse out which means when we put our mouse over something yjen something happens and when you remove your mouse something else happens
        // 4. on submit this is usually used on forms were we enter some details and we want to save them
        // 5. on load is used to refresh the screen
        // (dom) \\
        // dom library this library stands for document object model it has some inbuilt functions of java script like we have html tags to creare buttons, p tags, input boxes, etc.
        // dom library gives us the functios which helps us create all these kind of thing like buttons , input boxes, etc.
        // that means we don't have to use button tag or input tags to create these things we can use the dom library 
        // dom library is another way but it only has a few functions so you can't replace all html with java script because not all tags have functions in dom only a few of them have it 
        // in order to save time we can use it 
        // it has other functions too like document.getelementbyid , by class name , by tag name 
        // -------------Example 1 : onmouseover abd onmouseout------------------------------
        // we will habe a image. when mouse is over iamge the size of image increases and whne mouse is out on screen the size of image decreases
        // we will create two functions for both onmouseover and onmouseout and in one function we will incraese the szie and in another 
        // functionwe will decrease the size and then call bothe function on them 
        function onmouseover_img(x){
            // we use width and height to increse size. we cannot use width and hieght directly on img tag as we do not have img tag here 
            // in js. so we create variable on which we use width and height. after that when we call function
            // variable is replaced with img
            x.style.width="100px";
            x.style.height="100px";

           }

            function onmouseout_img(x){
             x.style.width="30px";
             x.style.height="30px";
            }

    //---------------------------------------onkeydown------------------------------------------
    //when we pressa key from keyboard some action is being performed.
    //okeydown for when we press, onkeyup when we release

    document.getElementById("demo").style.backgroundColor="red"
