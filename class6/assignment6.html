       <p>A Lifelong Love of Learning Begins Here

        For 64 years, Valley Christian Elementary School has existed to guide children on individual paths to self-discovery and a life-long love of learning!
        
        As a Valley Christian Elementary School student, your child will be invited to go on a Quest for knowledge, guided by caring teachers and supportive friends, to discover who God created them to be. Our unique K-12 programs have been specifically designed to give students more opportunities than they ever thought possible, providing hands-on experiences in STEM, the Arts, Business and Entrepreneurship, and Athletics. Your student will enter Valley Christian Junior High confident in who they are and prepared with the skills to think creatively and critically.</p>
