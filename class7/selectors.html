        <!----------------
        Selector means we tell who we want to so the style eg : class, id, tag, group selector.
        Class
        When we have different tags eg : p tag and h1 tag and we need to same styling for both of them. We can give same name to both the tags and then we can 
        directly so styling to that class only. Lets say if we do style of both seperately by copy and pasting it will not take much time but it makes the code bigger. Second way is we give same class name to both tags and we do style we do to that class which will
        save tiem and make code shorter. In short when we have different tags but same style we want for them use class. we can give classname
         when style is done then we write .classname{all style is given}. classnames are always given in opening tag
        ---------------------->

        <h1 class="c">My name is Adhvaith</h1>
        <p class="c">My age is 10</p>

        <!----------------Id 
        When we have same tag but we need to do different style thennw egive different id to both of them eg : we have two h2 tags and we need to do different stylke to both of them then we give different id to them in opening tag
        when style is done we use #idname{all style is given}
        -->

        <h2 id="id1">I really like coding</h2>
        <h2 id="id2">I am learning to create websites</h2>

        <!----Tags
        When we style to tags it will get applied to all tags means if there are 4 images on screen and we style to img tag  then all 4 iamges will have same style
        -->

        <!---Group selector
        When we together need style different tags. eg : We have h3 and h4 and both tags we need same style on whole page that means no matter how many times h3 and h4 is repeating all will have same style.
        but in class onlthose tags who shre same classname will have same style others will not. this is to save time
        -->
        <h3>My name is Adhvaith</h3>
        <h3>My name is Adhvaith</h3>
        <h4>I am very smart </h4>
        <h4>Intelligent too</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Home</li><!-- when one tag is inside other tag and we want to style of inside tabg w eca first write nam of outer tag and then anme of inner tag then style will get applied to inner tag
            
            eg : in below case we want to style li tag then we firts write ul and then we write li 
            ul li { all style is done here}

            , is given when we do style of two seperate tags. 

            There is another way to it we can give either give classname or idname to it and do style
