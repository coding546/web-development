        <!--List tags are those tags which help to create a list. This means we have text but with either numbers or bullets etc..
         and text are in different line by default. eg : create a list of all shopping items so we will start creatinmg with numbers in different line.
         if we use p tag to create list no numbers or bullets will come automatically you have to type it by yourself.
         it might not go to next line by itself

         but all these things happen in list tag because that is what it does
        Types of List are :
        1. Ordered List : We use ol tag and inside that another tag li. li is used to give name of the list
         Ordered list is a list where we can count the list.(numbers, alpahbets, roman numericals).
         by default numbers will come. We can use type in opening tag of ol to use alpahbet or roman
        eg : type="a" or type="A" or type="i" or type="I"

        2. Unordered List : This will use ul tag and inside that we use li tag. This list is the one which we are unable to count. bullets(disc), square, circle.
        by default disc will come. But w ecan change type by writing it inside the opening of ul tag.
         eg : type="square" or type="circle"

         3. Defination List: Here we first write title and then we give description of that title.
         First we use dl tag stands for description list then  inside we use dt tag stands for defination list here we give title. 
         the we use dd tag which means defination description for giving description.
