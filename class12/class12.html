<!-----positions,display proporties and navigation bar---->
<!--position:absolute;,top,left,right,bottom is used to set the position from all the directions according to the starting of the page which means if we use this it will throw the element in to the beggining from the top and will count the position from there
if margin does not work, we need to adjust any tag on top of the other tag etc. in this situation we can use position absolute


position:relative;,top,left,right,bottom this sets the position according to the tag which is closest to it
example if the p tag is closer to the button tag then it will be adjusted according to the button
-->
<button>click me</button>
<p>p-p-p-p-p-p-p-xp-p-p-p-p</p>
<!--display proporties
 display inline is used to put all tags in one line
 display:inline-block; is also used to put things in one line but those things should be div tag ex. if we have four div tags and we want them in one line we use it
 display:block; is used to put every thing in vertical order
 display:none;-->
 <!--navigation bar is bar that we always create at in the top of a website which lets you navigate to different pages ex. home,about us,contact us, login etc.-->
 <!--we can use p tag, ul tag, div tag etc.-->
 <ul>
    <li>
        home
    </li>
    <li>about us</li>
    <li>contact us</li>
    <li>sign up</li>
    <li>login</li>
