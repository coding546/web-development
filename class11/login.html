    <!--div tag is a tag which is used to create a invisible box which we can see only if we do styling on it this box is used to put different things inside of it like buttons,labels etc.
    in login page the black box will be created with the div tag the div tag is mainly used to put everything together in order to make css easy and to create a box it also makes our code organized as for different sections we can make different div tags.-->

    <!---postions
    1. margin : margin-left, right, up, down to give space

    2. padding: padding-left, right,up, down gives space inside box. eg : if we want to give space from left inside box like button, div tag then padding-left can be used.###################

    3 position : absolute. this is also like margin used to adjust position from left, down, right, up. difference is it adujust according to whole page from top eg. : if we use top:20px to image thenit gives from top of the screen 20 px of space.

    if we use margin-top:20px then presntly wherever picture is let say in center then from that position nit moves 20 px down.

    ao in short position-absolute considers space from top of the wall. and margin considers space fro current position
    
    when marginndoes not work use position:absolute

    how to use it 
    position:absolute;
    top:
    left:
    right:
    down: 

    use it

     mqalso when we adjust anything on top of something different eg : image on button. div tag we use position:absolute. margin does not work-->
